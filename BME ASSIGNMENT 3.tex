In many countries, healthcare process may vary but according to our country INDIA if we are having any problem than we try to recover ourselves by taking medicines by first aid,by consulting nearest or small doctors,if it problem is severe than we consult with the best doctors so that we can get quick diagnose by medical services,therapeutic services,along with the best check up which is done by pathologies.\\
Healthcare facilities includes hospitals, clinics, outpatient care centers, and specialized care centers, such as birthing centers and psychiatric care centers.\\

\item  \textbf{Preventative care:} helps detect or prevent serious diseases and medical problems before they can become major.
\item  \textbf{Physical and occupational therapy:} Physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) are types of rehabilitative care. While they have similar goals and treat many of the same conditions, they also differ. PT focuses on restoring or improving movement, strength, and range of motion. OT aims to improve the motor skills you need to perform daily tasks.
\item \textbf{ Nutritional support}
\item  \textbf{Pharmaceutical care}
\item  \textbf{Prenatal care: } is the health care you get while you are pregnant. It includes your checkups and prenatal testing. Prenatal care can help keep you and your baby healthy.

\subsubsection*{The effects of COVID-19 on healthcare in India} 
With the COVID-19 pandemic putting even the world’s most advanced healthcare systems to the test, India’s healthcare system has also been disturbed. While usually sufficient, healthcare in India found itself on its knees by the ferocious second wave of COVID-19 in April 2021. \\

A devastated Indian healthcare system infrastructure was brutally exposed by the lack of oxygen and drugs required for the treatment of COVID-19 in India. Additionally, the lack of awareness regarding healthcare insurance made it very difficult for the ordinary person to receive the full extent of in-patient care for COVID-19.
Thus we are hoping we'll get the best healthcare services in future.
Now peoples are involving his interest in social media so that there they can see many of the types of things related to modern healthcare' So they can easily get much aware about it.
